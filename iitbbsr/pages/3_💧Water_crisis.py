Farmers, dependent on consistent irrigation, face dwindling yields as droughts and erratic rainfall disrupt growth cycles. This water scarcity not only diminishes the quantity of produce but also its quality, affecting the livelihood of countless farmers. Consequently, the economic stability of the region is threatened, exacerbating poverty and food insecurity.")
